### "The Rift" Toolset

#### What is the rift?
It is a set of tools created to allow "transdimensional" jumping within Arma.
The aim is to make it both seamless and performance friendly in a multiplayer environment.

#### What tools are managed by this toolset?
* Clientside hiding and showing of "transdimensional" objects and beings
* Clientside post process switches to predefined "dimension styled" filters
* Client based targetting (i.e. People cannot be targetted by beings not in their current dimension)
* Clientside disruptive tools, such as:
	+ Sound distortion based on current "dimension"
	+ Damage based on whether or not protective gear is worn in the rift
